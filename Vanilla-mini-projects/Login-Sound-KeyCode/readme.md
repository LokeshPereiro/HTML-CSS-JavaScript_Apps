# Wavy Looin, Sound Board & KeyCodes

This small project aims to build 3 interesting front-end utilities/widgets that could be useful for our upcoming big projects or simply for UI purposes. Here the following projects:

- Animated wavy Login form: Wave effect on the labels when our inputs are in focus
- Sound board: different sounds will be played thanks to html audio tag
- KeyCodes: small app tells us which key from on they keyboard has been pressed
